# M4-Competition

Time series forecasting is the process of using historical data to predict
future values of a continuous sequence of data points, measured at regular
time intervals. This technique is widely used in various fields, including
finance, economics, weather forecasting, and supply chain management,
to name a few. The goal of time series forecasting is to identify patterns
and trends in the data and use them to make accurate predictions about
future events. There are three primary approaches to time series forecast-
ing: heuristic, statistical, and neural network models. Each approach has
its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of approach depends on the
specific characteristics of the data and the forecasting problem. Accurate
time series forecasting can have a significant impact on business decision-
making, resource allocation, and strategic planning. It enables organiza-
tions to anticipate demand and adjust production accordingly, manage
inventory and supply chain logistics, identify trends and opportunities for
growth, mitigate risks and uncertainties, and optimize resource allocation
and budgeting.
The M4 dataset, which we worked on, consists of 100,000-time series, each
with a unique set of characteristics, providing a challenging and diverse
testbed for evaluating the performance of different forecasting models.
For this project, we will be focusing on the hourly time series from the
M4 competition dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for time series
forecasting. To evaluate the performance of each model, we will use a
range of metrics, including mean squared error (MSE) and symmetric
mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). Our goal is to develop a hybrid
model that combines the best-performing models from each field to create
a robust and accurate forecasting model. By evaluating the performance of
each model and combining its strengths, we can create a hybrid model that
outperforms individual models and provides more accurate and reliable
forecasts.
